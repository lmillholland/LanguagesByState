# LanguagesByState
Find the official language of each U.S. state (from its Wikipedia page).

Running run.py will produce an output file named < statelanguages.csv > containing a list of states and their official languages.

Another (possibly better) resource for this information can be found at: http://www.netstate.com/states/tables/state_languages.htm
